## Static pages build using HTML and CSS:

![physics](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/714968085223702610/1136392484272996402/image.png)


## Pages using Javascript or backend logic to send email:

![reviews](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/714968085223702610/1136392537456775328/image.png)

The above page has a fully functioning drop down menu that dynamically updates not only the innerhtml of the dropdown menu but filters through the list of reviews which is recieved by the django backend through a REST API

![callback](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/714968085223702610/1136392592838365254/image.png)

The above page sends an email to the user thanking them for the request for a callback. I get an email from myself with their information to learn about the new request using django's email module
